# Binary Representation of Numbers

This repository contains a Java program that demonstrates how to convert a decimal number into its binary representation using the concept of remainders and loops.

## Usage

To run the program, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository.
4. Compile the Java file by running the following command:
5. Run the compiled program by executing the following command:
6. The program will display the binary representation of a sample decimal number.

## Explanation

The `Fun` class in the `Fun.java` file contains the main method where the conversion from decimal to binary takes place. Here's a brief overview of the program flow:

1. A decimal number is declared and initialized.
2. A list is created to store the remainders of the divisions by 2.
3. Using a while loop, the decimal number is repeatedly divided by 2, and the remainders are added to the list.
4. Finally, a for loop is used to print the remainders in reverse order, giving the binary representation of the decimal number.
